# Project Overview
This project analyzes an HR dataset focusing on employee compensation and demographics. The dataset, named "Salaries.csv," contains information on 397 employees, including their job title (rank), gender, years of service, years since their highest degree (year_since_phd), and salary.
# Purpose
The primary purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationship between these variables, with a specific focus on identifying and understanding potential gender-based disparities in compensation and career advancement within the organization.

# Steps performed in the analysis:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Missing Value Check
3. Salary Analysis by Gender and Rank
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Gender Distribution
6. Rank Distribution for Female Employees
7. Years of Service Analysis
8. Years Since Ph.D. and Years of Service

 # Conclusion
 The analysis reveals a significant gender disparity in salaries and career progression among university professors. 
 
 # Key findings
* There is a gender pay gap, with male professors earning more on average than female professors.
* The analysis of the dataset, comprising 397 employees, reveals a significant gender disparity, with only 39 female employees compared to a considerably larger number of male employees. This clear underrepresentation of women, constituting approximately 10% of the workforce, indicates a substantial gender gap requiring further investigation and action.
* There are differences in years of service and years since Ph.D. between male and female professors, suggesting potential systemic biases affecting career progression.
